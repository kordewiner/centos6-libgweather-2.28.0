# centos6-libgweather-2.28.0
All Mate and GNOME apps are no longer able to display weather forecasts on CentOS release 6.8, because National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the United States (NOAA) has discontinued one of their APIs in August 2016, one that libgweather-2.28 uses. So we stop using the broken http://weather.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/mgetmetar.pl (National Weather Service) script and use http://aviationweather.gov/metar/data (Aviation Weather Center) instead. Of course, you may need the files from  http://vault.centos.org/6.7/os/Source/SPackages/libgweather-2.28.0-5.el6.src.rpm too.
